# Interactive Module Book for the Platform TÃ¼KITZMed

This HTML-based module book is automatically deployed under https://integrative-transcriptomics.github.io/tuekitzmed-module/

The module is divided in three different blocks:

- Classes: Different learn paths for different courses. 
- Modules: Every module consists of multiple units and is categorized into one of the three major topics: Machine Learning, Mathematics and Applications. Moreover, each module can be allocated into one or many classes. See below for more infomraiton. Consider that the three major topics cannot be adapted from the CSV files but only from the HTML programming. 
- Units: Also named "learning nuggets". It might correspond to one single video of the platform. 

## Updating the module

To update the website, please change the three CSV files found in this repo and commit the changes. After commiting in the main branch, the deployment would automatically start.
